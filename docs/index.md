### Abstract

The utilization of natural language instructions represents an apex in human-technology interaction efficiency. This paradigm is conspicuously demonstrated through the deployment of voice-activated virtual assistants and chatbots that process natural language inquiries. With ongoing advancements in science and engineering, integrating natural language commands into sophisticated technical fields is becoming increasingly feasible. The emergence of advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) marks a pivotal shift in this direction. This paper explores the synergy between traditional simulation tools and the inferential capabilities of LLMs, setting the stage for a revolutionary approach to conducting simulations. Specifically, it posits the integration of LLM-based agents capable of interfacing with external applications and software via APIs to autonomously manage intricate tasks within the realm of computational geomechanics. Herein, we introduce and discuss the implementation of autonomous simulation agents driven by LLMs, highlighting their potential to redefine the landscape of simulation practices.
